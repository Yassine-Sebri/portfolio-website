      `Ever since I laid my hands on my first computer at the age of 9, I've been hooked. It was a basic model, but I spent countless hours tinkering with it, exploring its features, and discovering what it was capable of.`,
      `My passion for coding and development started in my teenage years when I started building simple websites and experimenting with programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It wasn't much, but it paved the way for me to learn more exciting things.`,
      `As I grew older, my interest in hacking and cybersecurity also grew. The challenge of finding vulnerabilities in systems and figuring out how to exploit them is addicting. Now, I have a good grasp on a wide range of topics from Networking and Cybersecurity to Cloud and DevOps.`,
